## 1.2 (05/18/2021)

### Highlights

- Added timeout mechanism. DLR checks at a few points whether the elapsed time for the current image is longer than its value. If so, DLR will end the flow. Timeout prevents one image from costing too much time.

- Added parameters for lines filtering:
  - `LineStringLengthRange` is used to define the minimum and maximum string length when running the recognition process on a specific line.
  - `MaxLineCharacterSpacing` is used to control the spacing between characters treated as one line.

- Improved the regular expression parameter by supporting more [RegEx pattern syntaxes]({{ site.parameters-reference }}label-recognition-parameter/parameter-control.html#textregexpattern).

- Improved the recognition accuracy when dealing with skewed and italics characters.

- Improved the recognition accuracy for serif fonts.

## 1.0 (02/24/2021)

### Highlights

- Supports text recognition from BMP, JPEG, PNG and single-page TIFF files.
- Supports zonal OCR and provides three ways to localize text areas:
    - Pre-define an area manually in pixel or percentage.
    - Specify an area relative to the barcode zone, which allows you to recognize accompanying texts near the barcode. 
    - Specify an area relative to blocks which share the same colour or uses the same font colour. A common example would be a price tag, where the text of interest is always on a yellow square background, the yellow square can serve as the reference region.
- Supports specifying a regular expression to improve recognition accuracy and robustness.
